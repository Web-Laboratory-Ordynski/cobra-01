                        <p class="post__p"> This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About
                            twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The
                            locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of
                            animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then
                            deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                            nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
                            contain.
                        </p>

                            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the
                            most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it
                            should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                            revolvers upon them.

                            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if
                            they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in
                            his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of
                            beasts!"
